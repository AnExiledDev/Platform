## Ways to connect with GSA

There currently are two ways you can connect with GSA:

### DediConnect
The auto-pilot for dedicated root machines and game servers that is actually easy to set up and requires zero technical experience.

### RconConnect
Connect self-hosted / rented game servers to supervise and access most other tools.
