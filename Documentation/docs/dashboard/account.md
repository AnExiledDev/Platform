### Default dashboard
GSA will automatically switch you to your default dashboard when you log in on the dashboard.

### Create dashboard
Create new (demo) dashboards for new communities or for testing purposes.

Demo dashboards show dummy data and will auto-destroy after a predetermined period. 

### Leave dashboard
You can leave dashboards you were invited to. It's currently not possible to leave a dashboard you created.

## Personalize

### Nickname & timezone
Your nickname is visible to other admin team members, on the activity log and more. Select the timezone you are in so the dashboard can show any dates and time according to your timezone.
