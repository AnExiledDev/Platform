## Game server not starting

## Increased memory usage

## Not showing on game server list
Some games have known issues, like servers not showing up in the server list, which sadly is caused by an in-game bug: The in-game server browser has a limit of 5000 servers. This is an issue since there are more than 10.000 game servers and there is no guarantee that your game server will appear on the list.

We strongly recommend registering your game server on a server listing websites, if you are interested in getting new players.
You can also add the game server to your favourite server list via Steam or you can use the free community website to get direct access to your game server.
