## Known issues
- When adding steam ID's to the whitelist, it automatically bans anyone not on the whitelist.
  There is no on/off switch. Simply remove all steam ID's from the whitelist if you don't want it active.


## Connecting to the game server
Valheim can sometimes have difficulties finding the game server or connecting with it.
By far the most consistent method to connect is: Join game -> Join IP -> enter IP:GAME_PORT.
