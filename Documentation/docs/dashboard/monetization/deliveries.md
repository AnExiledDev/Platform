## Delivery details
Each delivery comes with a log, that shows exactly what happened.
You can change the recipient Character, retry failed deliveries or archive a delivery. Any associated sub-packages will show up on the details page as well.

Every action on a delivery is logged to help you understand what happened. This is especially helpful when deliveries are failing.
